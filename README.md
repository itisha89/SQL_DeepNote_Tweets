### Business Problem and Dataset Overview:

The task involves analyzing Twitter usage patterns among different age groups to understand how younger and older generations engage with the platform. Insights from this analysis can inform marketing strategies, user engagement plans, and product development, especially in targeting the appropriate demographic segments.

### Dataset Details:

1. **Tweets Table:**
   - **Columns:**
     - `user_id`: The unique ID of the user.
     - `tweet`: The content of the tweet.
   
2. **Users Table:**
   - **Columns:**
     - `user_id`: Unique ID of the user.
     - `username`: The name of the user.
     - `age`: Age group of the user (e.g., "young", "old").
   
3. **Followers Table:**
   - **Columns:**
     - `user_id`: ID of the user.
     - `follower_id`: ID of the user‚Äôs follower.

### Platform Used:
- **Deepnote** for running the SQL queries and data analysis tasks.

### Steps for Dataset Integration and Setup:

1. **Tables Creation:**
   SQL statements were used to create the three tables (`users`, `tweets`, `followers`) with appropriate data types and constraints like `PRIMARY KEY` to ensure data accuracy and integrity.

2. **Inserting Data:**
   Data from CSV files (`users.csv`, `tweets.csv`, `followers.csv`) was inserted into the respective tables using the `COPY` command with delimiter set to a comma.

3. **Data Description:**
   SQL commands like `DESCRIBE` and `SELECT LIMIT` were used to describe the structure of the tables and display the first few rows of each table.

4. **Null Value Checks:**
   The dataset was checked for null values in all the tables using `SELECT COUNT(*)` to ensure completeness.

### Data Analysis:

1. **Tweet Count by Age Group:**
   - The number of tweets was calculated for each age group (`young` vs. `old`). This was done by joining the `users` and `tweets` tables on the `user_id` and grouping the data by the `age` column.
   - Query:
     ```sql
     SELECT age, COUNT(text) AS tweet_counts
     FROM users
     INNER JOIN tweets ON users.id = tweets.id
     GROUP BY age
     ORDER BY tweet_counts DESC;
     ```

2. **Number of Followers by Age Group:**
   - The average number of followers was calculated for each age group by joining the `users` and `followers` tables and grouping the results by `age`.
   - Query:
     ```sql
     SELECT age, COUNT(followers.following) AS avg_followers
     FROM users
     INNER JOIN followers ON users.id = followers.id
     GROUP BY age
     ORDER BY avg_followers DESC;
     ```

3. **Top 10 Hashtags:**
   - To extract the top 10 hashtags, the `text` column from the `tweets` table was split into individual words, and hashtags (words starting with `#`) were counted.
   - Query:
     ```sql
     SELECT parts, COUNT(*) AS count
     FROM (
         SELECT id, unnest(string_to_array(text, ' ')) AS parts
         FROM tweets
     )
     WHERE parts LIKE '#%'
     GROUP BY parts
     ORDER BY count DESC
     LIMIT 10;
     ```

4. **Top 10 Hashtags Used by Younger Users:**
   - The process was similar to the above, but filtered for younger users (age = 'young'). A temporary table was created to store the hashtag parts for young users and then queried for the top 10 hashtags.
   - Query:
     ```sql
     CREATE TEMP TABLE temp_parts AS
     SELECT unnest(string_to_array(t.text, ' ')) AS parts
     FROM tweets t
     INNER JOIN users u ON t.id = u.id
     WHERE u.age = 'young';

     SELECT parts, COUNT(*) AS count
     FROM temp_parts
     WHERE parts LIKE '#%'
     GROUP BY parts
     ORDER BY count DESC
     LIMIT 10;
     ```

5. **Age Group Interaction:**
   - To determine whether young or older users tend to follow others within their same age group, a comparison was made between `user_id` and `follower_id` to see if both belonged to the same age group.
   - Query: 
     This step likely involves identifying the relationship between the user's age and the follower's age using a self-join on the `users` table, which would be based on `user_id` and `follower_id`.

### Key Insights:

- **Tweeting Patterns:** Younger users tweet more frequently than older users.
- **Followers:** Younger users tend to have a significantly higher average number of followers compared to older users.
- **Hashtags Usage:** Specific hashtags like `#musicmonday` and `#music` are very popular among younger users, indicating their higher engagement with music-related content.
- **Age Group Following Behavior:** This analysis can help in understanding if both young and older users engage more with peers from their own age group or if there's a broader cross-age interaction.

This analysis provides key insights into user behavior on Twitter, particularly across different age groups, and can help tailor strategies for engagement, marketing, and platform development.
